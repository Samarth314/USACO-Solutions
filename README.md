# Competitive Programming
This a catalog of the competitive programming I have done for various online judges such as USACO, CodeForces, etc. Some early solutions were written in Python, but now I'm programming in C++. Feel free to browse around and look at them, but please keep in mind I'm still learning and some solutions (especially the earlier ones) are far from elegant. As these problems are getting more and more difficult the commit rate for this repo has slown down, but feel free to smash that star button to keep me going :)
